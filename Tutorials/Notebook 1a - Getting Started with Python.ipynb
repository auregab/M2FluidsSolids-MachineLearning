Once you are in an infinite loop (one that never stops), click on the [Kernel] menu item at the top of the window and select [Interrupt Kernel] or [Restart Kernel]. This will end your Python session and start a new one. When you print something to the screen in your `while` loop, it may not be possible to break out of the loop and you may need to end your Jupyter session (and potentially lose some of your work). Because of these problems with errors in `while` loops, it is recommended to use a loop with a break rather than a while loop when possible. ","metadata":{}}]}
